<h1>📅 Timetable & Task Manager</h1> 
A streamlined application designed to help users organize their weekly schedule with a clean, visual interface.

<h2>🚀 Development Roadmap</h2>
After doing basic development now today I'm currently following a structured 4-step plan to build out the core functionality of this app.

<h3>🏗️ Phase 1: Architecture & Layout</h3>
<b>Component Architecture:</b> We are splitting the app into small, manageable pieces. This makes the code cleaner, faster, and easier to fix if something goes wrong.<br>

<b>Weekly Grid View:</b> Implementing a professional "Timetable" layout. This gives users a bird's-eye view of their entire week at a glance.

<h3>⚙️ Phase 2: User Features</h3>
<b>Task Editing:</b> Users can now click on existing tasks to update details, change times, or rename them on the fly.<br>

<b>Dark Mode Support:</b> A built-in Light/Dark mode toggle to ensure the app is comfortable to use at any time of day.
